## 📌 Project Overview

**MedHealth Insights Hub** is a data-driven health analytics project aimed at analyzing the health profiles of medical students. The project explores patterns and correlations between health behaviors like smoking and physical activity, and biometric markers such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI.

The goal is to uncover actionable insights for early health intervention, prevention strategies, and increased awareness within young adult populations.

## 🔧 How we built it

### 📁 Dataset

I used a cleaned dataset titled `medical_students_cleaned.csv` containing attributes such as:

* Gender
* Age
* Smoking Status
* Exercise Frequency
* BMI (Body Mass Index)
* Blood Pressure
* Cholesterol Levels

### 🔍 Tools & Libraries

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** — for data cleaning and analysis
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — for beautiful, intuitive visualizations
* **Jupyter Notebook** — for step-by-step development and documentation

---

## ❓ Problem Statements & Key Questions

1. Are there differences in average BMI between male and female students?
2. Do smokers have higher average blood pressure and cholesterol?
3. How does exercise frequency relate to BMI?
4. Are older students more likely to have higher cholesterol?
5. What is the distribution of smoking status among students?
6. How does gender influence average blood pressure?
7. Are students who exercise more likely to have normal blood pressure?
8. What's the correlation between age and BMI?
9. Do students who don’t smoke and exercise have healthier profiles overall?
10. What percentage of students fall in the healthy BMI range (18.5–24.9)?

## 📊 Key Visualizations

* Violin plots comparing smokers and non-smokers (blood pressure, cholesterol)
* Bar charts for smoking distribution
* Boxplots of BMI by gender and exercise frequency
* Heatmaps for correlation matrix

---

## 🧠 Insights from the Data

* **Smokers** have **higher average blood pressure and cholesterol** levels compared to non-smokers.
* **Regular exercisers** typically have **lower BMI and healthier cardiovascular markers**.
* The **majority of students** fall into a normal BMI range, but **males** tend to have a slightly higher average BMI.
* There is a **positive correlation** between **age and cholesterol**, especially past age 25.
